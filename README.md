# Bottles

This program will allow a grocery store to keep track of the total number of bottles collected for recycling for seven days. The program will allow the user to input the number of bottles for each of the seven days. The program will calculate the total number of bottles returned for the week and the amount paid out (the total returned times 10 cents). The output of the program should include the total number of bottles returned and the total paid out.
